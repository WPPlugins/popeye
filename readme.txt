Popeye presents images from the Wordpress media library as an elegant javascript inline gallery within your posts and pages. 

== Description ==

Popeye presents images from the Wordpress media library in a nice and elegant way within your posts and pages. Use it to save space when displaying a collection of images and offer your users a simple way to show a big version of your images without leaving the page flow.

It is based on Christoph Schuessler's jQuery.popeye which was designed as an alternative to the often-seen JavaScript image lightbox (see Lightbox 2, Fancybox or Colorbox, just to name a few). In contrast to them it does not employ a modal window to display the large images, thus disrupting the workflow of the user interacting with a webpage, but takes a different approach: not only allows it for browsing all thumbnails as well as the large images in a single image space, it also repects the page flow and stays anchored and rooted in the webpage at all times, thus giving a less disruptive user experience than modal windows.

The plugin is very easy to set up and integrates automatically into your posts or allows you to use a shortcode. It comes with several styles but can be also easily customized to integrate into your blog's design. 

PHP5 is required for this plugin to work. 

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have PHP5 installed on your server.
1. Unzip `popeye-X.X.zip` into `/wp-content/plugins/popeye` 
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Choose your insertion mode & style in the 'Settings' menu
